    <p>In this project, I developed a neural network model for <strong>musical instrument classification</strong> using deep learning techniques. The goal was to analyze <strong>audio samples</strong> and accurately identify the instrument being played, such as trumpet, violin, or piano.</p>

    <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio Feature Extraction:</strong> Used <strong>Librosa</strong> to extract Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), a crucial feature for sound analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning Model:</strong> Built a neural network with <strong>TensorFlow and Keras</strong>, including a fully connected layer with <strong>256 hidden units</strong> and a softmax classifier for multi-class classification.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Experimented with <strong>different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimization strategies</strong> to improve accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency Analysis:</strong> Integrated <strong>Zeus-ML</strong> to measure GPU energy consumption, balancing model performance with computational cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Achieved Accuracy:</strong> Over <strong>99% validation accuracy</strong>, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in recognizing musical instruments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This project provided hands-on experience with <strong>machine learning for audio processing</strong>, reinforcing my skills in <strong>deep learning, data preprocessing, and model optimization</strong>.</p>
